          To create a new project first locate Unity Hub on your desktop or whatever 
          version of unity you have installed. I will be using version 2019.3.0f6

      <p>
        Here we are going to go over the basic navigation of the editor. How
        to move around in scenes, custom colors and layouts are what will be
        covered here as well as toggleing between 2D and 3D game modes.

        <h3>Switching between 2D & 3D</h3>
        <p class="col-8">
          If any of created the project in 3D mode and not 2D you don't have to worry
          as there is a way to toggle between 2D and 3D. You can find this right under
          there <b>scene</b> window.

        <p>
          To navigate the Editor you will primarily useing 5 different tools located
          in the top left of the screen under <i>File</i>. each of these tools can be
          quickly switched to by use its short - cut (Q, W, E, R, T)

        <h3>Custom Layouts</h3>
        <p>
          All the windows in the editor can be moved around and resized however you like.
          There are also a few layouts that are per-made which you can choose between.
          You will find the layouts in the <i>Layout</i> dropdown at the top right side
          of the screen.

            Now if you press the play button at the top 
            of the screen, by default I beleive there is no tint so how are you 
            suppose to know if your in play mode easly? Even if there is a 
            default tint you may want to change it to somthing you like. To do 
            this click <i>Edit -> preferences -> colors</i> and you will be able
            change the play mode tint.

            You change more that the playmdoe tint but I would suggest not doing

      <h2>Windows</h2>
      <p>
        For this section we are going to go over some of the windows that you 
        will have open while developing (Hierarchy, Scene, Game, Inspector, 
        Project, Animator, Animation, Console, Tile Palette). Each of these windows
        has its own special purposes and will make development much easier.
      </p>
      <!--scene, project-->
      <h3>Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>
        This window will have a list made up of all the game objects that are
        in the Scene. When you want to add something new to the Scene all you
        need to do is drag it from the Project folder into the Hierarchy window,
        or right click in the Hierarchy and you'll see a list of things you can
        add, there is also a little + icon at the top that you can click. It is
        in this window that you can child one object to another (you will see use
        of this window in the <a href="../HTML/TopDown.html">Projects</a> section).
      </p>
      <h3>Scene</h3>
      <p>
        The Scene window is very important because it is where you will be doing
        the majority of your work. You will be designing your levels and UI in 
        this window. That might not sound like a lot to you now but trust me
        your going to be here lots. You'll notice at the top of the window there
        are a bunch of buttons, those are cover below.

      <h3>Game</h3>
      <p>
        This window is what you will use when testing the game. After clicking
        the Play button at the top you will begin controlling the player object
        in here. You will notice the buttons on the top here as well, they are
        all quite self explanitory.
      </p>
      <h3>Inspector</h3>
      <p>
        You will be working in this window just as much as the Scene window,
        this is where you will be adding all the different components to the
        objects in the Hierarchy.
      </p>
      <h3>Project</h3>
      <p>
        Here is where all the assets you use are going to be located, this includes
        your scripts, images, sounds, models, prefabs and everything elese. It is
        important that you keep the organized with folders.
      </p>
      <h3>Animator</h3>
      <p>
        The responsibility of this window is to handle the animations and how they
        transition between one another. If this window is not open just go to 
        <i>Window -> Animation</i> and you will find it.
      </p>
      <h3>Animation</h3>
      <p>
        Here you are going to be making the animations for your game, this could
        be done useing sprite sheets or something else. (Note: until furthuer
        notice this will not be covered directly here but we do have a list of
        videos on the subject (We did not create any of the videos just created
        the playlist)).
      </p>
      <h3>Console</h3>
      <p>
        This is where errors, warrnings and logs from your scripts will be 
        printed. Using Debug.Log("hello world") will print to the Console
        hello world. Thats all there is to know realy.
      </p>
      <h3>Tile Palette</h3>
      <p>
        You will see this window get used in the 
        <a href="../HTML/TopDown.html#tileMap">Projects</a> section to create the layout
        of the level. To open this window go to <i>Window -> 2D</i> and you will 
        see it. I suggest you watch some 
        <a href="../HTML/VideoTutorials.html#creatingAssets">videos</a> on the subject

          <strong>NOTE: takes cannot be renamed after they are made.</strong>

        <p>The following is a list of the default tags in the editor.</p>

            The tag of an object can be found in the inspector window for any 
            GameObject. To add a new custom tag all you need to do is click 
            <i>Add Tag...</i> at the bottom of the dropdown menu. Or you can go 
            <i>Edit->Project Settings->tagsand layers</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            We can find an object with some tag using the 
            <b>GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag().</b>
            You will however notice that there is another function 
            <b>FindGameObjectsWithTag()</b>
            we only want to use the plural one if there are multiple GameObjects 
            with thedesired tag. <br>

      <h2>Layers</h2>
      <p>
        In this section you will learn about layers, both the <b>sorting layers</b> used 
        in 2D games and regular <b>layers</b> for all games.

        <div class="col-8">
          <p>
            Sorting layers are used with Sprites in a 2D game and they are for sorting
            the overlay order of the sprites. When the <b>Sprite renderer</b> component
            is added to a gameObject then under <i>Additional Settings</i> you will see
            that there is the <b>Sorting Layer</b> dropdown. There is also an order in
            layer so you can overlap sprites on the same sorting layer any way you want.
          </p>
          <p>
            To add a new <b>Sorting Layer</b> all you need to do in click <i>Add Sorting

          In the inspector window to the right of the <b>Tag</b> dropdown you may have
          noticed the Layer dropdown as well. These layers are usful for many things
          but here I'll just talk about how they help us when working with physics.

              Layers are helpful when we are working with physics because if we go to 
              <i>Edit -> Project Settings</i> in the top left hand corner then go to 
              physics 2D and scroll down you will see the Layer Collision Matrix dropdown. 
              Using this we can decide what objects can collide with and what they will 
              pass right through.  You can add a new layer the same way that a sorting 
              layer is added.

      <h2>Components</h2>
      <p>
        In this section we will cover some of the main components that you will 
        be useing. But first let me explain what a component is. the way that 
        Unity works is based off of components, components are scripts that are
        added to <b>GameObjects</b> to make them have different functionality.
        There are many per-made components that all have there own icons and 
        then there are the scripts that you will be writting which don't have there
        special icon but function the exact same way as all other components.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collider(s)</li>
        <li>Rigidbody</li>
        <li>Sprite Renderer</li>
        <li>Audio Source</li>
        <li>Animator</li>
      </ul>
      <div id="colliders">
        <h3>Colliders</h3>
        <p>
          There are a veriety of colliders in Unity, when you click add component and
          search for collider you will notice that there are 2D and 3D colliders. 
          Because we are focusing on 2D games we can ignore all things 3D.
        </p>
        <h3>List of 2D Collisers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Circel Collider 2D</li>
          <li>Box Collider 2D</li>
          <li>Polygon Collider 2D</li>
          <li>Edge Collider 2D</li>
          <li>Capsule Colider 2D</li>
          <li>Composite Collider 2D</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While there are six different 2D colliders they all function the same 
          essentialy. When you add one to an object there will be a light green
          outline, if it does not fit the size of the object to your liking you 
          can easly change it with the <i>Edit Collider</i> button. Just click 
          that and you will be able to change the collider around. The only other
          part we will discuss here is <i>Is Trigger</i> this will make it so 
          other object don't collide with it but pass through. Below I will link 
          to some resources that will help you gain a better understanding.

          Colliders work hand in hand with the <b>Rigidbody2D</b> without colliders
          objects would just pass right through each other. Now as you may recall 
          from the <a href="#layers">layers</a> section we have the ability to change what
          objects can collide with.

      <div id="rigidbody2D">
        <h3>Rigidbody</h3>
        <p>
          The <b>Rigidbody</b> is what allows a GameObject to be effected by 
          gravity and the rest of the physics engine behind <i>Unity</i>. You 
          can use the  <b>Rigidbody</b> within other scripts that you write to
          manipulate the gameObject with the attached rigidbody. The rigidbody
          has three different Body Types (Dynamic, Kinematic, and Static). The
          Dynamic body type will make the object be effected by all forces,
          the Kinematic body type requires you to apply some force to the 
          object in order for it to move. I won't discuss the Static body type
          because it is not used here. To learn more visit

      <h2>Prefabs</h2>
      <p>
        When making a game you will need to re-use game assets, these assets 
        are called <b>Prefabs</b>. <b>Prefabs</b> are copies of a game object,
        take for example an enemy. You don't want to create a new enemy from 
        scratch every time you need one, thats why you would make a prefab.
        It will store all the data about that enemy for easy re-uses. They
        are also very usful if we are spawning them into the game scene randomly,
        as without the prefab how would be tell the script what to spawn in.

        <b>NOTE: this is done using instantiate which is shown in the projects

      </p>
      <p>
        To create a <b>Prefab</b> first make a new folder called <i>Prefabs</i>
        then drag and drop the gameObject you want to make a prefab out of
        into that folder. Now you have a prefab, you can drag that into the scene
        as many times as you want and making a change to the prefab will update 
        all the <i>copies</i> that are in the game hierarchy. To learn more visit

      <h2>UI</h2>
      <p>
        The Unity Enige is equipted with many elements that are helpful when 
        creating a good <i>User Interface</i>. One important thing to note is 
        that the standard <b>text</b> element is quite blurry and its best to
        instead download the <i>TextMeshPro</i> Package. The following is a link
        to the a video on how to download it. 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D33d4w89vTs">How to download 
        TextMeshPro</a>. Here I will only be covering five of the UI elements. 
        These are the ones that you will be using the most, the others are up 
        to you.
      </p>
      <h3>Canvas</h3>
      <p>
        this is where all the UI elements are put to display them.
      </p>
      <h3>Panel</h3>
      <p>this panel is amazing</p>
      <h3>Text</h3>
      <p>
        This one is pretty self explanitory. It will display text in the Game 
        Scene. There are many different properties that you can change and I
        do suggest you play around with them. For example there is an Alignment 
        property if you look at the icons for it, they should be familier if you
        have ever used google docs or anything like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also possible to import your own forts. To do this follow the 
        following. Or you can click 
        <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Font.html">here</a> 
        to see it done in action.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>go to <a href="https://www.fonts.com/">fonts.com</a></li>
        <li>find a font you like</li>
        <li>download it, extract everything</li>
        <li>drag the extracted folder into Unity</li>
        <li>press the little <i>i</i> icon by font in the text</li>
        <li>find the font you imported</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Image</h3>
      <p>
        This one functions simmilarly to the Sprite Renderer, exept it is for UI
        purposes and the sprite renderer is for game play purposes. Really the 
        only way that you will learn to use this component proficiently is to
        start using it and make things. 
      </p>
      <h3>Button</h3>
      <p>
        This one is also pretty self explanitory. It's a button, you can set it up
        so that you can click on it some action will be triggered. Here we will
        walk through a simple tutorial that will change the color of some text when
        the a button is clicked on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The button element comes with a childed object as well, it is text. To

      <h2>Importing Assets</h2>
      <p>
        here we will go over importing 2D assets (art, sounds). When you first 
        import the art for your game it will most likely be all blurry, this is
        because of some compression that is done by the engine. To fix this just
        click on the image and change the Filter Mode to Point (no filter) and
        the Compression to None. When it comes to the sounds just drag and drop
        them into a folder called <i>Sounds</i> (You'll have to make this your
        self).

        <h2>Physics2D</h2>
        <p>
          When making games there is usually going to be some kind of physics 
          interactions taking place, this could be collisions or even just the
          player jumping. Either way having a good understanding of the Unitys
          2D physics engine will help you develop good 2D games.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!--getting started-->
      <div class="row">
        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>
          If you go to <i>Edit -> Projects Settings -> Physics 2D</i> you will open
          a window that allows you to limit the accuracy of physics simulations. One
          thing you should always keep in mind, is that the higher the accuracy the
          more time spend processing. When starting out in Unity you will most likely
          not need to do anything in this window other than interact with the Layer
          Collision Matix.

        <div class="col-8">
          <p>
            This matrix allows us to pick and choose what layers can collide with 
            each other. If you look at the check box in the far left column at the
            bottom row you can see it is checked this means that the objects in
            this <i>Obsticals</i> can collide with one another, where as the 
            objects in the <i>Bullet</i> layer cannot collide with each other.

        <h3>Scripting API</h3>
        <p>
          Now you may not need to change any of the settings but you will be using
           physics in your scripts. For example you may need to apply an upward 
           force to the player object to make them jump and come backdown, but 
           in order for them to jump you have to check that they are touching 
           the ground. There is lots to cover here so we will only be covering
           a small portion of it, mainly what you will need to no for basic 
           player controllers. Some of what we cover will be directly related to
           the rigidbody2D.

          <h3>Distance</h3>
          <p>
            This method calculates the minimum distance between two colliders.
            It could be used if you want the player to be within x units of 
            some enemy before it starts to move closer to them.

        <div class="row">
          <h3>IsTouchingLayers</h3>
          <p>
            This method will check weather the collider is touching any other
            colliders on some specific layerMask or not. It can be used to see
            if the player is touching the gound.

        <h2>Events</h2>
        <p>
          For this section we are goin to go over how events work and what they 
          help us do. You may find your self asking why events are being covered
          here and not in the <a href="CSharp.html">C#</a> section of the site.
          Well the reason is that the scripting side of things is not nearly as 
          important as how to use they effectivly in Unity. To see events in 
          action please go to <a href="TopDown.html">Top-Down shoot</a> in the 
          projects.
        </p>
      </div>
      <!--example-->
      <div class="col-12">
        <h3>Example: Were to use an event.</h3>
        <p>
          Lets say that in our game we have a GameController, which keeps track
          of how many deaths the player has. One way we could go about this would
          be to get a reference to the GameController in the Player scrip, and 
          in the Die() method of Player.cs add some logic for the GameController.
          There are many issues with this approach though, one of which is that
          the Player script now has a dependancy on the GameController. Another
          is wee may need to have the same logic we just wrote execute if something
          else happens to the player and now we need to write the logic we already
          have. We're programmers, and that means we are lazy and don't like doing
          the same thing over and over again. Now on the other hand if we are to
          use an event to handle the players death all we would need to do is
          create some event <i>playerDeathEvent</i> and we invoke it in the players
          death method. Then in the GameController script we subscribe some other
          method to the <i>playerDeathEvent</i> and all the logic in that method
          will be executed when the player dies. But we can now subsribe this
          method to other events and we only had the write the logic once.

          What you should take away from this is that events can make our code

      <h2>Staying Organized</h2>
      <p>
        Here I will just be telling you about some ways that you can keep 
        everything organized in both the editor and in Visual Studio.
      </p>
      <h3>In The Editor</h3>
      <p id="folder-creation">
        Basicaly the only thing I can tell you here is to make folder and keep things
        grouped together with those. To make a new folder just right click in the 
        project window and go to create.
      </p>
      <h3>Visual Studio</h3>
      <p>
        There many ways to stay organized in visual studio, you can ground methods and 
        fields by public, private an proteced and much more. To keep the fields that 
        are visible in the inspector use [Header("something")] to group fields or
        [Space()] to put a gap between them. But it is also just as important to 
        keep the code it self clean and easy to read. use #region NAME #endregion
        to group methods and fields to gether.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <p>
          As I have not shown [SerializeField] you propably do not know what it does.
          Some times there are variables that we want to access in the inspector and
          the are private so we use that to make them visible there, if they are just
          public then they will show there without it.

          After getting introduced to everything we are going to combine all the 
          new skill you've accquired into makeing two project games. One will be 
          a 2D side scroller, and the other will the a top-down shooter. I if you
          are completly new to everything about this I suggest you start with C# 
          here and move on accordingly.
