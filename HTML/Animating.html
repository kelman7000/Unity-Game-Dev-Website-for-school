    <h1>Animating</h1>
    <p>
      In this section we are going to learn about animations. The animations in
      Unity can be used to do many things, in fact you can even use nothing but
      animations to make a complex boss. This is helpful because it eliminates
      the need to write an enemy boss AI. 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD4JIXQDw0s">
        Brackeys - How to make a BOSS in Unity!
      </a> is a video that will walk you through boss creation with 
      animations. I implore you to watch the video. The first thing that
      we are going to cover in this section is the animator component.
    </p>
    <!--Animator component-->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Animator</h2>
      <div class="col-8">
        This component is essential when working with animations. It will need to
        be on any object that you wish to animate, if you were to create a new 
        <i>clip</i> for some object in the heirarchy it would automatically add
        the <i>Animator</i> component to that object. As you can see to the right
        the <i>Animator</i> has something called a Controller, this is what handles
        which animation should be playing at what time given some condition.
      </div>
      <div class="col-4">
        <img src="../Images/animating/animator_component.jpg"

    </div>

    <!--Animator & Animation windows-->
    <div class="row">
      <h2>Animator & Animation Windows</h2>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>
          There are two windows that you are going to need if you are working with
          animations. To open these windows go to <i>Window->Animation</i> and you
          will see one called Animator and another called Animation, open both of
          these and dock them somewhere in the editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have an object in the heirarchy selected and have the Animation
          window open there will be a button that says <em>Create</em>. As you 
          may recall from earlier if you add a clip right now to this object
          the Animator component will be added to the object automaticaly. One
          thing you should make a habbit out of is creating a folder called
          <i>Animations</i> and sub folders inside that foreach object that you
          animate.

              For this section we are going to learn how to make an animation clip.
              This is going to make our game object look and feel more dynamic to
              the player. In this example we are going to animate the little green 
              guy to the right, its only going to have one animation that will show
              him expanding and contracting verticaly.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>NOTE: I will not be covering how to setup the project to start
                animating the slim character.</strong> <br> 
                The first thing we are going to do is open the two required windows

        <h4>Steps for Anmiating</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Download the slim sprite sheet <a href="">here</a></li>
          <li>Open the two windows that are needed to animate</li>
          <li>Select the slim game object</li>
          <li>Go to the Animation window and click <i>Create</i></li>
          <li>Name to clip slim_move</li>
          <li>Select the sprite sheet</li>
          <li>
            <ol>
              <li>Sprite Mode - Multiple</li>
              <li>Pixels Per Unit - 100</li>
              <li>Filter Mode - Point (no filter)</li>
              <li>Compression - None</li>
              <li>Click Apply then Sprite Editor</li>
              <li>Click the Slice dropdown</li>
              <li>
                <img src="../Images/animating/sprite_editor_config.jpg" 
                     alt="slice configuration: type - automatic, pivot - center,
                     method - delete existing">
              </li>
              <li>Click Slice</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

       <!--slim sprite sheet-->

       </div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12">
        <p>
          Now that the sprites are all setup, you need to click on the little 
          gray arrow on the right side of the sprite sheet and select all the 
          images. Make sure you have the slim object selected and drag the 
          sprites into the <i>Animation</i> window and drop them there. This
          will create <i>Key Frames</i> each one will be responsible for one
          of the sprites. You will want to space them all apart by one like
          so

      <div class="col-12">
        <h3>Animation Clip Properties</h3>
        <p>
          If you navigate around in the <i>Project</i> folder and find the
          <i>slime_move</i> clip that was just made click on it and you will find
          that it tells you the length of the animation in frames and its FPS.
          You will also see a Loop Time check box you this will need to be checked 
          for all animations that you want to play multiple times otherwise the
          animation will play one time then end.

      <h2>Animation Transitions & Parameters</h2>
      <p>
        Here we are going to cover how to transition from one animation to 
        another. This is all handled in the <i>Animator</i> window.
      </p>
      <p><b>NOTE: project setup will not be covered here</b></p>
      <p>
        In the <i>Animator</i> window you will see 
        <img src="../Images/animating/plus_icon.jpg" alt="plus icon"> 
        if you click on it you will be presented with a small dropdown of
        primitives. We can add these to the animation to be used as conditions
        that need to be met in order for a transition to take place. There will
        be a node for each of the clips in this window as well.
      </p>
      <!--animator states-->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6 col-s-12">
          <img src="../Images/animating/animator_states.jpg"
             alt="image of all the stats for the animator (Player_Fall, Player_Run,
             Player_JetPack and Player_idle)">
        </div>
        <div class="col-6 col-s-12">
          <p>
            When a node is orange that means that it is the default animation
            that will play. If you pay attention to the arrows coming and going
            from each node you will propably assume that these are pointing
            to the animations that each clip can transition into. I.e. Player_idle
            can go to Player_Run and Player_JetPack where as Player_Run can 
            transition into any of the other four states. But we need to add some
            conditions to these transitions so the <i>Animator</i> knows when to
            switch animations. This is were <b>Parameters</b> come into play.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <!--animator params and conditions-->
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <div class="col-8 col-s-12">
            <p>
              For this characters <i>Animator</i> we only need four parameters (
              VelocityX, VelocityY, Grounded, JetPack) the first two are floats
              and the other two are or type bool. To start useing these for
              transition one would click on one of the arrows for example the one
              going from Player_idle to Player_Run they would see a section 
              called Conditions all they would have to do is add one.
              In this case we want the VelocityX param to be greater than 0.01, 
              if this condition is met then the <i>Animator</i> will start playing 
              the run animation for the player. Now we need a script that will 
              pass values into these parameters.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this project I created the script PlayerAnimController, the
              implementation is not optimal but will get the point accross.
              This script works by taking values from other objects and passing
              them into the Animator component. To set the values of parameters
              in the Animator you will need access to the Animator component on
              the game object. Below is an image of the script
            </p>

          a 2D side scroller, and the other will the a top-down shooter. I if you
